* Purpose
Quick and easy web server to serve static files.  Not very
configurable, but the start of something very easy to extend.

** Getting Started

Run these commands:

#+BEGIN_SRC 
go install
web
#+END_SRC

Should see in the terminal:

#+BEGIN_SRC 
binding server to 127.0.0.1:3000
#+END_SRC

Edit the code to your liking, etc.

** Via Docker

For convenience you can use the `run.sh` file to build and run the
docker image.  Run the commands below to build the image and start the
container.

#+BEGIN_SRC 
./run.sh build
./run.sh start
#+END_SRC

Once the container is started and running you can then use

#+BEGIN_SRC 
./run.sh logs
#+END_SRC

Which should output something like this

#+BEGIN_SRC 
2020/02/03 20:58:15 binding server to 0.0.0.0:3000
#+END_SRC

When done simply stop and remove the container and the image.

#+BEGIN_SRC 
./run.sh reset
#+END_SRC

Or if you just want to stop the running container and keep the image
run the following.

#+BEGIN_SRC 
./run.sh stop
#+END_SRC
